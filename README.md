## ü§î Usage

1. After activating your plugin license, you will be prompted into a Welcome Screen, and all you have to do from there is enter your `Google API key` press the `Get Started` button. <p>![Google API Key Input](https://i.ibb.co/HDNNTkZ/image-27.png)</p>

2. After Entering your Google API Key, you will be prompted to the dashboard. Next thing to do is Add your service areas to the list. You can do that by hitting the `Add Service Area` button and a form will pop up. <p>![Add service area button](https://i.ibb.co/fxVmJJw/Group-79-1.png)</p>

3. On the form, set your location by choosing from the three dropdowns(country, state, city). <p>![](https://i.ibb.co/RBLsNNY/Group-78-1.png)</p>

4. Once you set your location, the `Neighbourhoods` text box will be propagated with the neighbourhoods data we've pulled from google. You can `Add` or `Remove` your own neighbourhoods to the text box as long as you separate them with commas(,) <p>![](https://i.ibb.co/cFwvj30/image-30.png)</p>

5. For the `Google Maps Place ID` section, if a GMB Listing is available for this location, you can add the Place ID here. If you have a physical branch in this location but dont have a GMB Listing, you can tick the `Use street address and zip code` checkbox and enter your `Street Address` and `ZIP Code`. After that you can  <p>![](https://i.ibb.co/xSg5gCL/image-31.png)</p>

6. For the sake of the demo, I've added 2 locations to the list. So now, the next thing you need to do is that we need to set your primary location. To do that, Hit the three dots `more icon`, and hit `Set as Primary Location`. <p>![](https://i.ibb.co/gDTXqzC/Group-80-1.png)</p>


7. After all of that, all we need to do now is to import all the data from our server into your website. There are two ways to do that; import them one by one, or import them all together. To import them one by one, you can hit the `More Button > Import Data`. To import them all together, you can hit the `Import All Data Button`. Both of these buttons does not work if you haven't set up your Primary Location. <p>![](https://i.ibb.co/F39JJtT/Group-80-2.png)</p>

8. After the data is pulled from our server, you can see from the green indicators marked `Available` which means that the data is now available in your website. Also, the `Code Icon` will be enabled, and when you click it, you can see the different shortcodes for each components. You can click them to copy the shortcodes instantly. <p>![](https://i.ibb.co/VtyfFTm/Group-81.png)</p>

9. Now, all that is left to do is use it on your actual location page. To do that just simply copy the component shortcode that you want (in my case, I clicked `Copy All Components` to copy all components) and paste the shortcodes to wherever part of the page you want it to be placed. <p>![](https://i.ibb.co/QPXBzxN/image-35.png)</p>

10. After pasting the shortcodes, and then save it. Then you can now go to your new location page. With
