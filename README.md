## ü§î Usage

1. After installing the plugin, open up the dashboard and it will redirect you to the `Settings` tab. You can not proceed if you dont setup the settings first. From here, enter your **Primary Keyword** without any location. Also enter your **Business Name.** If you have a Google Business Profile, it would be better if you could enter in the exact name of your GBP. <p>![Settings Tab](https://i.imgur.com/0FetC8e.png)</p><p>After setting up your settings page, the next step is the `Locations` tab. </p><p>![Locations Tab](https://i.imgur.com/dbiVSOj.png)</p>

2. In the `Locations` tab, you need to add your **Service Areas** and to do that click the `Add Location` button at the top right corner. <p>![Add Location Button](https://i.imgur.com/0pTVMBF.png)</p>

3. It will then take you to the `Create New Location` form. From here, select from the three dropdowns the `Country`, `State`, and `City` of your Service Area. <p>![Select Location](https://i.imgur.com/jUAX4Dj.png)</p>

4. After choosing from the `City` dropdown, The `neighborhoods` text area will load up all available neighborhoods data we have on our database. Some locations may have a lot, some may have few, and some may have none. The `neighborhoods` text area is completely editable. You can add or remove any neighborhoods as you please. Just make sure to separate each with commas. <p>![Neighborhoods](https://i.imgur.com/bcKB1vb.png)</p><p>We are still currently working on adding data to our database as we'd love to cater as much of our subscribers as possible. If you want to request for a location to be added, just email us at seorockettools@gmail.com or write a support ticket at <a href="https://support.seorocket.dev/" target="_blank">our supoprt channel</a>.</p>

5. The `GBP Place ID` is the next field. Although it is not required, it is recommended that you enter a Place ID **IF AND ONLY IF** you have a GBP in that city. This will be used to pull in the reviews from your GBP. If you dont have a GBP in this city, **DO NOT** enter anything. <p>![GBP Place ID](https://i.imgur.com/8nvAT4r.png)</p>

6. Click `Create` button at the buttom and wait for the plugin to pull in all the geocentric data. <p>![Create Button](https://i.imgur.com/knOBeiw.png)</p>

7. After creating a Service Area or a Location, click the `shortcodes` icon to show the shortcodes. <p>![Shortcodes](https://i.imgur.com/GePXkM0.png)</p>

8. All that's left now is to copy the `shortcodes` and paste them into your Service Area Pages. <p>![Copy Shortcodes](https://i.imgur.com/ZaRQjgD.png)</p>
